:zap: :zap: :zap: Clone me! You can modify GameController.c and make your own games that will run on this circuit! If you make one, message us, @darnells and @krislaw would love to play it! :zap: :zap: :zap:

## ---> Hardware
#### Kris built a gameboy-like pcb using TI's tm4c123gh6m microcontroller, a sitronix ST7735 LCD, and an arduino joystick
See **Resources/TM4Cports** for a description of the TM4C port hookups
:bangbang: COMING SOON: See **Resources/???.sch** to find out how to build the circuit
