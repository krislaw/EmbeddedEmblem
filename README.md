:bangbang: COMING SOON: Tutorial on how to play

:zap: Did you know? You can clone my repo and change GameController.c to add your own games that will run on the circuit! :zap:

## ---> Hardware
#### Kris built a gameboy-like pcb using TI's tm4c123gh6m microcontroller, a sitronix ST7735 LCD, and an arduino joystick
See **Resources/TM4Cports** for a description of the TM4C port hookups
:bangbang: COMING SOON: See **Resources/???.sch** to find out how to build the circuit

## Preview
